HoneyGuard 
HoneyGuard protects Indian beekeepers from ₹2000cr annual adulteration losses through a 90x90mm 8-layer production PCB combining honey purity detection with comprehensive hive health monitoring.

Purity Detection (97% vs lab HPLC): BME688 VOC gas spectroscopy + AS7341 11-channel spectral analysis identifies rice syrup/HFCS/cane sugar contamination at frame level.

Hive Intelligence: SHT30 temperature/humidity (brood optimization), microphone (varroa/swarming acoustics), HX711 load cell (yield prediction), microSD (7-day logging).

Real-time 0.96" OLED dashboard shows purity score, weight delta, environmental conditions, and disease alerts. nRF52840 delivers BLE 5.4 (150m), QSPI flash, 6+ month battery life.

Mission: Enable premium pricing for genuine multiflora honey while providing predictive hive management - sustainable beekeeping intelligence at scale.
